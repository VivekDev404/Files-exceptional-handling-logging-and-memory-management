        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "- Exception handling is a mechanism in Python to handle runtime errors, so the program doesn't crash. It uses try, except, else, and finally blocks to catch and respond to exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "- The finally block is executed no matter what, whether an exception was raised or not. It is typically used for clean-up actions, like closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "- Logging is a module in Python used to track and record events that happen during program execution, especially for debugging and monitoring purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The __del__ method is a special method in Python called a destructor, which is invoked when an object is about to be destroyed. It's often used for cleanup tasks, like closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "- import imports the entire module, whereas from ... import allows importing specific attributes or functions from a module.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "- You can handle multiple exceptions by using multiple except blocks, or by specifying multiple exceptions in a single except block using a tuple.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "- The with statement ensures that resources like files are properly managed and automatically closed after use, even if an exception occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "- Multithreading involves multiple threads running in a single process, sharing memory space, while multiprocessing involves multiple processes with separate memory spaces, often used to leverage multiple CPU cores.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "- Logging helps track the program's behavior, debug issues, monitor performance, and keep records of events and errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "- Memory management in Python refers to the automatic allocation, use, and deallocation of memory. Python uses a garbage collector to manage memory by reclaiming unused objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "- The basic steps are: try (attempt code execution), except (catch exceptions), else (execute code if no exceptions), and finally (execute cleanup code).\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "- Efficient memory management prevents memory leaks and optimizes the performance of programs, ensuring resources are used efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "- try block is used to write the code that might raise an exception. except block is used to catch and handle exceptions raised in the try block.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "- Python's garbage collector uses reference counting to track objects. When an object's reference count drops to zero, it is automatically deallocated. Python also uses a cyclic garbage collector to handle circular references.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "- The else block runs if no exceptions are raised in the try block, allowing you to define actions that should only be executed if the code runs without errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "- The common logging levels in Python are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL, each representing the severity of the logged message.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "- os.fork() creates a child process by duplicating the parent process, while multiprocessing allows the creation of multiple processes with separate memory spaces and independent execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "- Closing a file ensures that all resources are freed, and any pending data is written to disk. It also prevents file corruption and avoids file locks.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "- file.read() reads the entire content of a file as a string, while file.readline() reads one line at a time from the file.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        "- The logging module is used to log messages that track the flow of a program, errors, and debugging information in a standardized way.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        "- The os module provides functions to interact with the operating system, including file operations like opening, reading, writing, and checking for file existence.\n",
        "\n",
        "23.  What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        "- Memory management challenges include preventing memory leaks, optimizing memory usage, and dealing with cyclic references that the garbage collector may not automatically clean up.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        "- You can raise an exception using the raise keyword followed by the exception you want to raise, like raise ValueError(\"Invalid value\").\n",
        "\n",
        "25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "- Multithreading is useful for concurrent tasks, improving performance in applications that involve I/O-bound operations like network communication or file handling.\n"
